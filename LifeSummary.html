<h1>My Life In One Page</h1>

<h2>Pre-Mission</h2>
<hr>
<pre>
	I was blessed to have been born into a loving family.  When I was born we lived in the state of California in the United States of America.  When I was<br>
two-years old we moved to Arizona where I grew up.  When I turned twelve-years old we moved to <a href="http://www.sc.gov" target="_blank">South Carolina</a>.  This move prepared me for the next stage of<br>
my life--my mission.

<h2>Mission</h2>
<hr>
<pre>
	I was blessed to serve a mission in the Durban South Africa Mission which encompassed the <a href="http://www.southafrica.com/kwazulu-natal/" target="_blank">KwaZulu Natal</a> province and the <a href="http://www.gov.sz/" target="_blank">Swaziland Kingdom</a>.  My mission<br>
was a wonderful experience which changed my life for the best by helping me become more Chirst-like.  I would not be the person I am today without my mission.

<h2>Post-Mission</h2>
<hr>
<pre>
	After my mission, I met my beautiful wife at a Young Single Adult Conference.  Soon after that we got married at the <a href="https://www.lds.org/church/temples/columbia-south-carolina?lang=eng" target="_blank">Columbia South Carolina Temple</a>.  Two<br>
beautiful girls and six-years of marriage later brings us to-date.  Though there have been challenges and trials, I have many blessings which I am<br>
grateful for!
